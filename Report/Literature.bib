@article{Luo.2018,
 abstract = {A diode-pumped, passively mode-locked laser emitting at 915 nm with a praseodymium-doped yttrium lithium fluoride (Pr:YLF) crystal was demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Utilizing two polarization-combined blue pumping laser diodes (LDs) and a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM), stable continuous-wave (CW) mode-locking operations were achieved with a maximum average output power of 408 mW and a slope efficiency of 10.8{\%}. Laser pulse durations of 15 ps were obtained with a spectral full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.15 nm and a repetition rate of 1.53 GHz.},

@article{Richter.2006,
 abstract = {We describe a new approach for the generation of coherent ultraviolet radiation. Continuous-wave ultraviolet light at 320 nm has been obtained by intracavity frequency doubling of red-emitting Praseodymium lasers. Lasing at the 640-nm fundamental wavelength in Pr:LiYF(4) and Pr:BaY(2)F(8) was realized by employing an optically pumped semiconductor laser at 480 nm as pump source.Using LiB(3)O(5) as nonlinear medium, {\~{}}19 mW of ultraviolet radiation with {\~{}}9{\%} optical efficiency with respect to absorbed power was reached for both laser crystals; the visible-to-ultraviolet conversion efficiency was 26{\%} and 35{\%} for Pr:LiYF(4) and Pr:BaY(2)F(8), respectively.},

 abstract = {We report on efficient lasing of Pr-doped fluoride materials with cw output powers up to 600 mW in the visible spectral range. Praseodymium doped LiYF(4) and LiLuF(4) crystals were pumped either by an intracavity frequency doubled optically pumped semiconductor laser with output powers up to 1.6 W and nearly diffraction limited beam quality or by a multimode GaN-laser diode with an output power of about 370 mW. Furthermore, intracavity frequency doubling of the red Pr-laser radiation to 320 nm reaching output powers of more than 360 mW with a conversion efficiency of 61{\%} and an optical-to-optical efficiency of 22{\%} are presented.},
